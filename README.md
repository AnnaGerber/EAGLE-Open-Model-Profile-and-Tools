# EAGLE
Project EAGLE: OpenSourceSDN Repository for the ONF Information Model Project (IMP).
This repository contains all the documents and code that the ONF-IMP has open sourced.

The master branch of this repository only contains the license files. Each of the sub-project-specific branches will contain folders/files that are relevant to that sub-project. So in essence this repository has multiple master-branches, one per sub-project.
The following are the list of sub-projects and their associated branch

Open Model Profile --> OpenModelProfile
ONF Common Information Model releases --> OpenCommonInformationModel
CIM Pruning & Refactoring Tools --> UmlTools
PapyrusUML to Yang Generation --> UmlYangTools
Yang to SwaggerJSON/RestConf Generation --> YangJsonTools
ONF Modeling Guidelines and documentation --> Documents
