# EAGLE
Project **EAGLE**: OpenSourceSDN Repository for the **ONF Information Model Project (IMP)**. This repository contains all the documents and code that the **ONF-IMP** has open sourced.

The master branch of this repository only contains the license files. Each of the sub-project-specific branches will contain folders/files that are relevant to that sub-project. So in essence this repository has multiple master-branches, one per sub-project.

The following are the list of sub-projects and their associated branch (Note: Guidelines and documentation are contained in the corresponding branches):

1. Open Model Profile --> OpenModelProfile
2. CIM Pruning & Refactoring Tools --> UmlTools
3. PapyrusUML to Yang Generation --> UmlYangTools
4. Yang to SwaggerJSON/RestConf Generation --> YangJsonTools
